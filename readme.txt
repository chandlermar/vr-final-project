Motivation

There are currently 2D and 3D implementations for Artificial Particle life; however, there is not an interactive VR option. This will serve as an educational experience that allows users to explore emergent behavior regarding simple rules particle interactions. 

VR is specifically well suited for simulating particle life, as the user will feel fully immersed in the world of complex behavior. We want to show how a life-like system emerges from simplistic particle motion law.

We hope that this project will inspire the study of particle life and a deeper interest in the STEM field. Further, we believe that this project also raises interesting philosophical questions regarding simulation theory and the foundation of the universe.



How the App Works

This application uses an algorithm to scan nearby particles and determine their behavior based on the user’s set rules. Particles then interact based on these set rules, and the user can view formations they make.


How the User Interacts with the Application

The user can interact with the different rule sliders to change the particle’s defined rulesets as well as grab different objects and interact with them. The user can also use teleport locomotion to get around and snap turning for an easier viewing experience.
